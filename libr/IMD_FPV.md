                                     IMD and FPV



	What is IMD?
	------------

	IMD is an abbreviation for "Intermodulation Distortion", and is a concern 
	to FPV pilots when multiple FPV pilots fly at once. When two modulated RF
	signals (VTX signals) are broadcast at the same time third-order distortion 
	products are observed, which are close to the original broadcast signal 
	frequencies. 

	It is these third-order distortion products that are the IMD. They manifest 
	frequency content on nearby frequencies, sometimes called "spectral regrowth".

	IMD score, and therefore video clarity score, is lowered as IMD frequencies
	get closer to the broadcast VTX channels and by the increasing times the IMD 
	frequencies are close to broadcast VTX channels in total.
